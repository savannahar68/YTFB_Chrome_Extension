# Video Volume Sync and Skip Ads

A browser extension that automates skipping ad on YouTube and other similar platform. This won't block Ad by will automate the process of skipping ad which we can do by clicking on "Skip Ad" after 5 seconds. Along with this it also control the volumne of all the videos on facebook and similar applicaiton. Right now on facebook all the video has a separate volume component which is set at 100% or Mute (This is irritating for me as we need to manually control volume for each video), so to automate it, we can set volume for once video and all the other videos will be played with same volume range (website specific)


The Ad skips will take place after 5 seconds on platform like youtube automatically if you have this extension installed.
