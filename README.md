# Audio Sync and Skip Ads

A browser extension that automates skipping ad on YouTube and other similar platform. This is not an ad blocker, it just automates the process of clicking on the "Skip Ad" button on YouTube. Along with this it also control the volumne of all the videos on facebook and similar applicaiton. Right now on facebook all the video has a separate volume component which is set at 100% or Mute (This is irritating for me), so to automate it, we can set volume directly from chrome extension for all the videos (website specific)


The Ad skips will take place after 5 seconds on platform like youtube automatically if you have this extension installed.
